# APCS A with VSCode
*Purpose of creating this repo is because a lot of students this year is taking APCS A with FLVS related. This course is using BlueJ which is old and can not help students since in my mind the test is just about getting all the syntax and algorithms right, which means that a editor would help them more*

## Software to use
VSCode / VSCode insider
**standard one or insider one is your choice, not mine. But this repo is based on VSCode, this course only includes few basic stuff so students can save their time on finising their java homework.**
